title: "Battery Low:<br>An Analysis of Washington State’s Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger Distribution"
---

## Introduction
<div id="intro"></div>

For this project, we will be using two main datasets. The first dataset is an Electric Vehicle Population Dataset, which contains information about all EVs registered in Washington State. Sourced from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data), this dataset provides detailed location data for analyzing population density. Our second dataset, an EV Charging Station dataset, is from the [U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity-locations#/analyze?country=US&region=US-WA&show_map=true). This data set stores the locations of all publicly available charging stations in Washington. 
	For our central research question, we want to explore how well-distributed EV chargers are across Washington State compared to the distribution of registered EVs. Are there areas of the state that need more charging stations? Where are EV owners more likely to find a station? To answer these questions, we will compare the population of EVs to the population of EV charging stations by county.
